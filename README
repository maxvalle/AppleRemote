What is it?
The AppleRemote class is a REALbasic class to handle input from the Apple Remote device. It supports both the white and aluminium remotes and it's compatible with Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.7. REALbasic version 2009r5 or later is required.

Where did it come from?
This class is based on the Cocoa code of Martin Kahr <http://martinkahr.com/source-code/> which is also based on what discussed here: <http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?UsingTheAppleRemoteControl>
